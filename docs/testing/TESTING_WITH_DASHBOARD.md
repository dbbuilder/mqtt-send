# Testing the MQTT Bridge with Dashboard Buttons

## üéØ Interactive Testing - No Scripts Needed!

The dashboard now has **built-in test buttons** - no need to run PowerShell scripts anymore!

---

## üöÄ Start the System

```powershell
cd D:\dev2\clients\mbox\mqtt-send
.\Start-System-Safe.ps1
```

**What happens:**
1. ‚úÖ Stops any existing services (ensures clean rebuild)
2. ‚úÖ Checks Docker is running
3. ‚úÖ Waits for SQL Server to be healthy
4. ‚úÖ Starts Mosquitto
5. ‚úÖ Builds all services fresh
6. ‚úÖ Starts Publisher, Receiver, Dashboard
7. ‚úÖ Opens http://localhost:5000

## üß™ Testing with Dashboard Buttons

### Section 1: Send Test Messages (MQTT ‚Üí Database)

**Location:** Top section, left column "Send Test Messages (MQTT)"

#### Button 1: Normal Temp (72¬∞F)
**Click:** Blue "Normal Temp (72¬∞F)" button

**What it does:**
1. Dashboard sends MQTT message to topic: `test/temperature/TEST1`
2. Payload: `{"MonitorId":"TEST1", "SensorType":"temperature", "Value":72.5, "Unit":"F", ...}`
3. Receiver (if configured for `test/` topics) picks it up
4. Stores in RawSensorData

**Where to see results:**
- **Dashboard:** Live Message Flow (bottom) ‚Üí Blue "RECEIVED" badge appears
- **Database:**
  ```sql
  SELECT TOP 5 * FROM dbo.RawSensorData
  WHERE DeviceId = 'TEST1' AND SensorType = 'temperature'
  ORDER BY ReceivedAt DESC;
  ```

#### Button 2: High Temp (85¬∞F - Alert)
**Click:** Yellow "High Temp (85¬∞F - Alert)" button

**What it does:**
- Same as Button 1 but with value = 85.0¬∞F
- Tests high-temperature scenarios

#### Button 3: Pressure (101.3 kPa)
**Click:** Teal "Pressure (101.3 kPa)" button

**What it does:**
- Sends pressure sensor data
- Topic: `test/pressure/TEST1`
- Payload: `{"MonitorId":"TEST1", "SensorType":"pressure", "Value":101.3, "Unit":"kPa", ...}`

---

### Section 2: Trigger Publisher Events (Database ‚Üí MQTT)

**Location:** Top section, middle column "Trigger Publisher Events"

#### Button 1: Publish from TableA
**Click:** Green "Publish from TableA" button

**What it does:**
1. Dashboard inserts random data into `dbo.TableA` (MonitorId 1 or 2)
2. Publisher polls TableA every 2 seconds
3. Publisher finds new record and publishes to MQTT (`data/tableA/1` or `data/tableA/2`)
4. Receiver (if configured) receives and stores in RawSensorData

**Where to see results:**
- **Dashboard status:** "‚úì Inserted test data into TableA" ‚Üí "Publisher will pick this up in ~2 seconds..."
- **Dashboard Live Flow (after 2 seconds):**
  - Red "PUBLISHED" badge ‚Üí `data/tableA/1` or `data/tableA/2`
  - Blue "RECEIVED" badge ‚Üí same topic received
- **Database:**
  ```sql
  -- Check inserted data
  SELECT TOP 5 * FROM dbo.TableA ORDER BY CreatedAt DESC;

  -- Check published
  SELECT TOP 5 * FROM MQTT.SentRecords
  WHERE SourceName = 'TableA'
  ORDER BY SentAt DESC;

  -- Check received
  SELECT TOP 5 * FROM MQTT.ReceivedMessages
  WHERE Topic LIKE 'data/tableA%'
  ORDER BY ReceivedAt DESC;

  -- Check final destination
  SELECT TOP 5 * FROM dbo.RawSensorData
  WHERE SensorType = 'temperature'
  ORDER BY ReceivedAt DESC;
  ```

#### Buttons 2 & 3: Publish from TableB / TableC
**Same as TableA** but for pressure (TableB) and flow (TableC)

---

### Section 3: Bulk Operations

**Location:** Top section, right column "Bulk Operations"

#### Button 1: Send 5 Random Messages
**Click:** Gray "Send 5 Random Messages" button

**What it does:**
- Sends 5 random MQTT messages
- Mix of temperature and pressure
- Random values: 70-90¬∞F or 100-105 kPa
- Topics: `test/temperature/TEST1`, `test/pressure/TEST2`, etc.
- 100ms delay between messages

**Where to see results:**
- **Dashboard status:** "‚úì Sent 5/5 messages successfully"
- **Dashboard Live Flow:** Multiple blue "RECEIVED" badges appear
- **Database:**
  ```sql
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM dbo.RawSensorData
  WHERE DeviceId IN ('TEST1', 'TEST2');
  ```

#### Button 2: Send 10 Random Messages
**Same as Button 1** but sends 10 messages

---

## üìä Where to See the Results

### 1. Dashboard - Real-Time (http://localhost:5000)

**System Overview (top cards):**
- Publisher: ONLINE, 3 tables monitored
- Receiver: ONLINE, 3 subscriptions active

**Statistics:**
- Messages sent today / total
- Messages received today / total

**Live Message Flow (bottom section):**
- **Red "PUBLISHED" badges** ‚Üí Database ‚Üí MQTT
  - Example: `[17:03:45] PUBLISHED data/tableA/1 | TableA ‚Üí TableA`
- **Blue "RECEIVED" badges** ‚Üí MQTT ‚Üí Database
  - Example: `[17:03:46] RECEIVED data/tableA/1 | Success ‚Üí 1 tables`

---

### 2. Database - SQL Queries

#### Check the Full Round Trip

```sql
-- Step 1: Data inserted into source table
SELECT TOP 5 RecordId, MonitorId, Temperature, Location, Timestamp
FROM dbo.TableA
ORDER BY CreatedAt DESC;

-- Step 2: Published to MQTT
SELECT TOP 5 Id, SourceName, Topic, SentAt
FROM MQTT.SentRecords
WHERE SourceName = 'TableA'
ORDER BY SentAt DESC;

-- Step 3: Received from MQTT
SELECT TOP 5 Id, Topic, Status, TargetTablesProcessed, ReceivedAt
FROM MQTT.ReceivedMessages
WHERE Topic LIKE 'data/tableA%'
ORDER BY ReceivedAt DESC;

-- Step 4: Final destination
SELECT TOP 5 DeviceId, SensorType, Value, Unit, ReceivedAt
FROM dbo.RawSensorData
WHERE SensorType = 'temperature'
ORDER BY ReceivedAt DESC;
```

#### Check Application Logs

```sql
-- All logs
SELECT TOP 20
    CONVERT(VARCHAR, Timestamp, 120) as Time,
    ServiceName,
    Level,
    Message
FROM Logging.ApplicationLogs
ORDER BY Timestamp DESC;

-- Only errors
SELECT TOP 20 *
FROM Logging.ErrorSummary
ORDER BY Timestamp DESC;
```

## üî¨ Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Test Receiver Only (MQTT ‚Üí DB)

**Steps:**
1. Click **"Normal Temp (72¬∞F)"** button
2. Wait 1-2 seconds
3. Check **Dashboard Live Flow** ‚Üí Should see blue "RECEIVED" badge
4. Run SQL:
   ```sql
   SELECT TOP 5 * FROM dbo.RawSensorData
   WHERE DeviceId = 'TEST1'
   ORDER BY ReceivedAt DESC;
   ```

**Expected:** New row with temperature = 72.5¬∞F

---

### Scenario 2: Test Publisher Only (DB ‚Üí MQTT)

**Steps:**
1. Click **"Publish from TableA"** button
2. Dashboard shows: "‚úì Inserted test data into TableA"
3. Wait 2-3 seconds (publisher polls every 2 seconds)
4. Check **Dashboard Live Flow** ‚Üí Should see red "PUBLISHED" badge

**Expected:** Message published to `data/tableA/1` or `data/tableA/2`

---

### Scenario 3: Test Full Round Trip (DB ‚Üí MQTT ‚Üí DB)

**Steps:**
1. Click **"Publish from TableA"** button
2. Dashboard status: "‚úì Inserted test data into TableA"
3. Wait 2-3 seconds
4. Check **Dashboard Live Flow**:
   - First: Red "PUBLISHED" badge appears
   - Then: Blue "RECEIVED" badge appears (same topic)
5. Run SQL to verify full flow:
   ```sql
   -- Check all steps succeeded
   DECLARE @LatestSent DATETIME2 = (SELECT MAX(SentAt) FROM MQTT.SentRecords WHERE SourceName = 'TableA');
   DECLARE @LatestReceived DATETIME2 = (SELECT MAX(ReceivedAt) FROM MQTT.ReceivedMessages WHERE Topic LIKE 'data/tableA%');

   SELECT
       'Published' as Step,
       CONVERT(VARCHAR, @LatestSent, 120) as Timestamp
   UNION ALL
   SELECT
       'Received' as Step,
       CONVERT(VARCHAR, @LatestReceived, 120) as Timestamp
   UNION ALL
   SELECT
       'In RawSensorData' as Step,
       CONVERT(VARCHAR, MAX(ReceivedAt), 120) as Timestamp
   FROM dbo.RawSensorData
   WHERE ReceivedAt >= @LatestSent;
   ```

**Expected:** All 3 steps have timestamps within 5 seconds of each other

---

### Scenario 4: Stress Test with Bulk Messages

**Steps:**
1. Click **"Send 10 Random Messages"** button
2. Wait for completion: "‚úì Sent 10/10 messages successfully"
3. Check Dashboard Live Flow ‚Üí Should see 10 blue "RECEIVED" badges
4. Run SQL:
   ```sql
   SELECT
       SensorType,
       COUNT(*) as MessageCount,
       AVG(Value) as AvgValue,
       MIN(ReceivedAt) as FirstReceived,
       MAX(ReceivedAt) as LastReceived
   FROM dbo.RawSensorData
   WHERE DeviceId IN ('TEST1', 'TEST2')
       AND ReceivedAt >= DATEADD(MINUTE, -1, GETUTCDATE())
   GROUP BY SensorType;
   ```

**Expected:**
- ~5 temperature readings, ~5 pressure readings
- All received within last minute

- SQL: New row in `SentRecords`

‚úÖ **Bidirectional Flow Working:**
- Click "Publish from TableA" ‚Üí Red "PUBLISHED" + Blue "RECEIVED" appear
- SQL: New rows in `TableA`, `SentRecords`, `ReceivedMessages`, `RawSensorData`

‚úÖ **Logging Working:**
- SQL: `Logging.ApplicationLogs` has entries from all 3 services
- Dashboard actions appear in logs

‚úÖ **Real-Time Updates:**
- Dashboard updates every 5 seconds automatically
- No need to refresh browser

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Test button clicked but nothing happens"

**Check:**
1. Open browser console (F12) ‚Üí any JavaScript errors?
2. Check if dashboard is connected to SignalR:
   - Dashboard should say "Connected to SignalR hub"
3. Verify services are running:
   ```powershell
   Get-Process | Where-Object {$_.ProcessName -match "ReceiverService|PublisherService|MonitorDashboard"}
   ```

### "RECEIVED badge never appears"

**Receiver might not be subscribed to test topics.**

**Fix:** Update receiver config to subscribe to `test/#` topics:
```sql
INSERT INTO MQTT.ReceiverConfig (ConfigName, TopicPattern, MessageFormat, FieldMappingJson, QoS, Enabled)
VALUES (
    'Test_All',
    'test/#',  -- Subscribe to all test topics
    'JSON',
    '{"DeviceId": "$.MonitorId", "SensorType": "$.SensorType", "Value": "$.Temperature", "Unit": "$.Unit"}',
    1,
    1
);

-- Add table mapping
INSERT INTO MQTT.TopicTableMapping (ReceiverConfigId, TargetTable, TargetSchema, ColumnMappingJson, Enabled, InsertMode, Priority)
SELECT
    Id,
    'RawSensorData',
    'dbo',
    '{"DeviceId":"DeviceId","SensorType":"SensorType","Value":"Value","Unit":"Unit"}',
    1,
    'INSERT',
    100
FROM MQTT.ReceiverConfig
WHERE ConfigName = 'Test_All';

-- Restart receiver to pick up new subscription
```

Then restart system:
```powershell
.\Start-System-Safe.ps1
```

### "PUBLISHED badge appears but RECEIVED doesn't"

**Topics might not match.**

**Check publisher sends to topics receiver is subscribed to:**
```sql
-- Publisher topics
SELECT SourceName, TopicPattern FROM MQTT.SourceConfig;

-- Receiver subscriptions
SELECT ConfigName, TopicPattern FROM MQTT.ReceiverConfig;
```

Make sure they overlap! For example:
- Publisher: `data/tableA/{MonitorId}` ‚Üí publishes to `data/tableA/1`
- Receiver: `data/tableA/+` ‚Üí subscribes to `data/tableA/*`

‚úÖ These match!
